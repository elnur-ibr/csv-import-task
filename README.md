# Comments
- Task requirement number3 was not clear "3 Check if file has a delimiter from settings â€“ if not, throw exception".
I hope I got it right. It was related to "sep=," at the begging of file.

# Improvement that could have been made
- Database and table names on settings table must be relational not string.
- Validation should be available list.
- Required fiealds could be seen on import form before uploading.
